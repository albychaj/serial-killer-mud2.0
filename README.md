serial-killer-mud2.0
====================

This is the new version. The us 2 version. 

Testing line update

Notes on give and get with two arguments:
- maybe instead of storing the giveRecipient and getRecipient in the sender player,
  it would be better to store the giveSender and getSender in the recipient player,
  that way they can only have one get and one give going at a time (?)
- or store the giveRecipient in the sender player and the getSender in the recipient
